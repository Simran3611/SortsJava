This is the README file for the program.

To start running the program. Type the following command into the terminal
java Main.java

This program will start off with asking the user what type of file they would like to enter.
The accepted input files are:
perm15K.txt
perm30K.txt
perm45K.txt
perm60K.txt
perm75K.txt
perm90K.txt
perm105K.txt
perm120K.txt
perm135K.txt
perm150K.txt

Then it will prompt the user to enter which type of a sort they would like to perform.
Valid input are:
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Heap Sort

Then it will display the amount of time in milliseconds it took to sort the chosen file. 

The output of the sorted items will be sorted in other files (ex IS15K.txt, MS15K.txt, HS15K.txt)
The sorted files are included in the same directory.
